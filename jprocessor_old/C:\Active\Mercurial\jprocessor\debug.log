RuntimeError: You called this URL via POST, but the URL doesn't end in a slash and you have APPEND_SLASH set. Django can't redirect to the slash URL while maintaining POST data. Change your form to point to localhost:8000/jobs/extractor/xmp/ (note the trailing slash), or set APPEND_SLASH=False in your Django settings.
