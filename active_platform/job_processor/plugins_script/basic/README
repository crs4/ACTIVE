This module contains an example of Plugin that can be used to define custom
functionalities and extend the ACTIVE core platform.
It can be used as base for new Plugins, providing also a manifest file in the
respective ACTIVE platform directory.

No useful script has been defined inside the utils.py module but they can be
edited very quickly using the imported modules and functions.
