"""
This module contains all code necessary to implement the semantic of each skeleton.
In particular it has been defined a class that similarly to a visitor pattern allow to evaluate
a skeleton; it is decomposed in its subskeleton and input data is distributed over them.
Inside the Executor class there is an eval method for each skeleton type/class, each one with its
own implementation.

Moreover each executor has a progress field used to provide an estimation of the current
evaluation progress. This field contains an integer percentage value which could be accessed by many thread
concurrently and each one tries to increment the progress values.
