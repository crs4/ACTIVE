This module is used to create an abstracton level between how parallel and distributed computations
are implemented and how they are organized through algorithmic skeleton primitives.
So the abstract class SkeletonRunner define a metod necessary to evaluate a generic skeleton,
providing input values and additional parameters.
SkeletonRunner abstract class could be implemented in different way, this leaves a great flexibility for
the definition of how computations are executed over a cluster of nodes or over a workstation.
