"""
This class is used to define a Job Manager, in order to handle the execution of generic activities (Job objects).
A Job Manager executes a limited number of jobs at time and then save their information in different queues (dictionaries)
based on the computation status.
So it is possible to obtain job objects queued, in a running status, completed or failed due to some computation error.
Each Job object is associated to a user by and id. This id is used to execute some operations only on jobs owned by 
a specific user (e.g. clean, get, getAll).
